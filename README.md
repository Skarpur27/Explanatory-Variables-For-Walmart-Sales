# Analysis of Factors Affecting Walmart Sales

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and analyze factors that significantly influence Walmart's sales. Through a comprehensive econometric analysis of a dataset containing various variables, we have applied several statistical tests to determine the impact of external and internal factors on sales figures.

## Methodology
Our approach involved a rigorous statistical analysis, including:

**Significance Tests**: To identify the variables that have a significant impact on sales.  
**Fixed-Value Significance Tests**: To assess the impact of specific variables at fixed values.  
**Linear Combination Tests**: For examining the relationships between different variables.  
**Variance Tests**: To evaluate the variability of sales data.  
**Variable Addition Test**: To see how adding new variables affects model performance.  
**Chow Test**: Utilized to test the stability of our model across different samples, ensuring consistency in the values.  
**Constraint Tests on Coefficients**: To understand the limitations and effects of coefficients within our model.  
**Indicator Variables**: Added to capture the effect of categorical variables.  
**Variable Selection and Elimination**: For optimizing the model by including only the variables that improve its predictive accuracy.  

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed that external temperature is a significant factor influencing Walmart's sales, suggesting a possible seasonality effect. Furthermore, the inflation rate appears to impact consumer purchasing power, thereby affecting sales figures. These findings underscore the importance of considering both environmental conditions and economic indicators in sales forecasting models.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis comprises various variables, including sales figures, external temperature, inflation rates, and more. Due to confidentiality and data privacy, the dataset is not publicly shared in this repository.

## How to Use This Project
To replicate our analysis or to apply our methodology to a different dataset, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required statistical software and libraries installed.
Run the analysis scripts on your dataset, adjusting variables and tests as necessary.
